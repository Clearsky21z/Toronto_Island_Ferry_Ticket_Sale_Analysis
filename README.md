# Toronto Island Ferry Ticket Sales Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the files and scripts used to analyze temporal patterns and passenger flow in Toronto Island ferry ticket sales. The analysis focuses on time series patterns, including daily, weekly, and monthly trends, seasonality, peak sales times, and day-of-week analysis. The goal is to provide insights into ferry operations and visitor patterns that can help optimize ferry services, especially during peak periods.
